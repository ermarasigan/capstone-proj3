ONE CONNECTION, ONE NATION: DICT LAUNCHES THREE FLAGSHIP PROJECTS

In line with the celebration of the National ICT Month, the Department of Information and Communications Technology launched its three priority projects: the National Broadband Plan, the National Government Portal and the Free Wi-Fi in Public Places last June 23, 2017.

The event marked the important milestones of each project, raising public awareness about the ongoing efforts of the DICT in enabling a more agile paradigm shift from digital divide to digital inclusion in the country.

The National Broadband Plan, approved by President Duterte last March, will serve as the data backbone for the National Government Portal and the Free Public Wi-Fi.

“We are trying to see how we can accelerate also the formulation of the feasibility study by talking to other potential sponsors to do the feasibility study like with the US government and Japanese government,” said Undersecretary Denis Villorente.

Discussions with the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) on the use of NGCP’s wide fiber optic network (about 5,000 to 10,000 fiber optic cables) from north to south are also underway. Through leasing of the spare capacity in its fiber optic lines, ubiquitous and inclusive broadband connection is within reach and the amount of time needed for implementation can be shortened.

The Free Public Wi-Fi project hails a new name, Pipol Konek, to put emphasis on the people dimension of the initiative, as it expands its reach to the unserved and underserved communities in the countryside.

Lastly, the National Government Portal, a one-stop shop of online government services and inter-government interaction, will reduce paper-based government transactions and promote efficiency in public service delivery. An Executive Order on portal migration of government agencies was submitted to the President for his signature.

The public may now access <a href='https://www.gov.ph/'>gov.ph</a> for government policies, news and links to government e-services.

These three flagship projects have come full circle to promote the national ICT development agenda.
